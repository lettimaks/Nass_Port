## Chicken Licken 3D Rendering Overview

This project showcases my detailed 3D rendering of a Chicken Licken restaurant, created using Blender. The goal was to bring the atmosphere of this popular fast-food brand to life by focusing on accuracy, realism, and scalability for potential use in visualizations, animations, or virtual environments. Through careful attention to lighting, textures, and model accuracy, the rendering captures the recognizable style and ambiance of a Chicken Licken restaurant setting.

## Key Features

- **Detailed Interior and Exterior Models**: Every aspect of the restaurant, from furniture and fixtures to the characteristic colors and signage, has been carefully modeled to maintain brand consistency and visual appeal.
- **Realistic Textures and Lighting**: Using high-resolution textures and advanced lighting techniques, the rendering replicates the warmth and energy of a real Chicken Licken location, enhancing the visual depth and making the space feel authentic.
- **Scalable Design for Multiple Uses**: The rendering can be easily adapted for different purposes, such as virtual tours, marketing visuals, or interactive media, allowing for flexibility in its applications.
- **Efficient Asset Management**: Organized assets and materials enable easy modifications, allowing the 3D model to be adjusted for new layouts, designs, or environments as needed.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Blender**: Used for all 3D modeling, texturing, and rendering to create a high-quality visual representation.
- **HDR Lighting**: High-dynamic-range images provided realistic lighting conditions, adding depth and ambiance to the space.
- **Texture Mapping**: High-resolution textures were applied to capture the materials used within the restaurant, from floors and tables to wall designs and decor.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was recreating the exact aesthetic of Chicken Licken's unique interior and branding while keeping the model flexible for potential modifications. Working with lighting and textures to make the virtual space feel as lifelike as possible was a valuable learning experience, enhancing my skills in creating realistic materials and achieving natural light dynamics.
